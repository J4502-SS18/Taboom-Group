  <h1>Resources</h1>
  <h2>For Journalists</h2>
  <p> Taboom will expand our ongoing capacity building efforts to
improve media coverage of religion and LGBTQI+/SSOGIE rights in
Sub-Saharan Africa with at least two country-specific journalist
trainings before April 2019. In 2016 and 2017, our team trained

more than 45 journalists from more than 25 countries across Sub-
Saharan Africa how to better report on religion and SSOGIE topics.

  <h2>Journalist Training and Development</h2>
  <p>Taboom will expand our ongoing capacity building efforts to
improve media coverage of religion and LGBTQI+/SSOGIE rights in
Sub-Saharan Africa with at least two country-specific journalist
trainings before April 2019. In 2016 and 2017, our team trained
more than 45 journalists from more than 25 countries across SubSaharan
Africa how to better report on religion and SSOGIE topics.
These two scoping training weeks in Cape Town helped us identify
Zimbabwe and Kenya as the two most suitable sites for week-long
country-specific trainings in 2018/19. Local partners have requested
additional interventions in Zambia, Rwanda, Uganda, Nigeria,
Malawi, and Ghana, and region-specific interventions in East, West,
and Southern Africa, indicating a clear and pressing need for this
project component.
Each intervention will include training and mentoring at least 20
journalists with local partners. We will use our existing Sub-Saharan
resources and curriculum along with newly created country-specific
guides. After each training, we will edit and publish trainees’ stories to enhance local and
international understanding of religion and SSOGIE rights. We will mentor trainees for at
least one year posttraining and assist them in spreading lessons learned throughout their newsrooms and media networks. Specific training sessions will address: journalists’ motivations
and professional obligations; key concepts and terms around SOGIE
issues and religion; media freedom challenges and opportunities;
structural inequalities; story ideas, angles and sources; source safety
and sensitivity; and news value and public interest. Trainees will
also analyze positive and problematic media reporting examples
and engage with local faith leaders and SSOGIE activists/
community members.</p>

<h2>Stakeholder Media Engagement Training & Development</h2>
<p>Our holistic approach to improving media coverage of religion and
LGBTQI+/SSOGIE rights will necessarily include sector-specific
media engagement training opportunities for key stakeholders best
positioned to advance positive and affirming narratives via local and
regional media outlets. Strategic influencers will include SSOGIE/
human rights activists, faith leaders, lawyers, and policymakers. We
will conduct at least four day-long country- or region-specific media
engagement trainings for inclusive and affirming stakeholders before
April 2019. These training sessions will equip at least 50 key
influencers with the skills they need to effectively spread affirming
rights-based and faith-based narratives via traditional and social
media channels. Specific training sessions will include audience
identification, messaging themes, message framing, storytelling techniques, traditional media outreach, story pitching, interview
preparation and follow-up, and social media strategy. In June 2017,
we conducted a successful media engagement training for regional
Arcus Foundation grantees, including activists and faith leaders, in
Nairobi. Local partners in South Africa, Kenya, Zambia, Rwanda,
and West Africa have asked us to conduct subsequent stakeholder
media engagement trainings for key influencers in their
communities, indicating a clear and pressing need for this project
component.</p>
