  <h2>Journalist Training and Development</h2>
  <p>Taboom will expand our efforts to
improve media coverage of religion and LGBTQI+/SSOGIE rights in
Sub-Saharan Africa with at least two country-specific journalist
trainings before April 2019. Over the past two years, our team trained
over 45 journalists from over 25 countries across Sub-
Saharan Africa on better reporting on religion and SSOGIE topics.
This session helped us identify
Zimbabwe and Kenya as the two most suitable sites for week-long
country-specific trainings in 2018/19. Local partners have requested
additional interventions in Zambia, Rwanda, Uganda, Nigeria,
Malawi, and Ghana, and region-specific interventions in East, West,
and Southern Africa, indicating a clear and pressing need for this
project component. </p>

<p>Each intervention includes training and mentoring over 20
journalists with local partners. We will use an existing Sub-Saharan
curriculum along with country-specific
guides. After each training, we will publish trainees’ stories to enhance understanding of religion and SSOGIE rights. We will mentor trainees for at
least one year after training, and assist them in spreading lessons learned throughout their newsrooms and networks. </p>

<p> Specific training sessions will address: journalists’ motivations
and obligations; key concepts and terms around SOGIE
issues and religion; media freedom challenges and opportunities;
structural inequalities; story ideas, angles and sources; source safety
and sensitivity; and news value and public interest. Trainees will
also analyze media reporting examples
and engage with local leaders, activists and SSOGIE
community members.</p>

<h2>Stakeholder Media Engagement Training & Development</h2>
<p>Our approach to improving media coverage of religion and
LGBTQI+/SSOGIE rights will include
media engagement training opportunities for area-specific stakeholders best
positioned to advance positive narratives via local and
regional media outlets. Strategic influencers will include SSOGIE/
human rights activists, faith leaders, lawyers, and policymakers. </p>

<p> We will conduct at least four day-long country- or region-specific media
engagement trainings for inclusive and affirming stakeholders before
April 2019. These sessions will equip at least 50 key
influencers with the skills they need to spread affirming
rights- and faith-based narratives via traditional and social
media channels. </p>

<p> Specific training sessions will include audience
identification, messaging themes, message framing, storytelling techniques, traditional media outreach, story pitching, interview
preparation and follow-up, and social media strategy. In June 2017,
we conducted successeful engagement training for regional
Arcus Foundation grantees, including activists and faith leaders, in
Nairobi. Local partners in South Africa, Kenya, Zambia, Rwanda,
and West Africa have asked us to conduct subsequent stakeholder
media engagement trainings for key influencers in their
communities, indicating a clear and pressing need for this project
component.</p>
