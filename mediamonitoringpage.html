    <h1> MEDIA MONITORING </h1>
  </header>
<section class="section1">
	<p> The SSOGIE Media Monitoring and Response Coalition (MMRC)
will mobilize media practitioners, activists, faith leaders, lawyers,
policymakers, and other affirming stakeholders to rapidly and
collaboratively combat dangerous and otherwise problematic media
portrayals of SSOGIE issues in a unified and systematic manner. This MMRC’s initial scope will be Sub-Saharan Africa, with the potential
to scale up to other regions pending adequate resources.</p>
  <p> Through strategic partnerships and targeted sub-grants, we aim to
enlist at least one media monitoring partner in each country across Sub-Saharan Africa to regularly
monitor, rate, translate and share local
media coverage of SSOGIE-related
content with the broader coalition
network via a shared platform and
centralized database. Individual media
monitors will rate each piece of media
coverage using a 10-point scale. The scale will be used immediately to
triage coalition responses and long term to monitor country- and region-
specific improvements anddeteriorations in SSOGIE-related
media coverage over time. A rating of “1” would indicate media clips that are excellent in their affirming,
ethical and responsible treatment of SSOGIE issues, triggering a
low-priority two-month response deadline before which local
media monitors should thank journalists for producing fair and
positive coverage and suggest additional story angles and sources
for subsequent coverage. A rating of “10” would indicate news
media content that is imminently dangerous in their irresponsible,
insightful or incendiary treatment of SSOGIE issues, triggering rapid
coordinated responses from local affirming stakeholders and continent-wide coalition partners if deemed prudent.
Specific response mechanisms and procedures will be collaboratively
drafted for each numeric point on the scale. Coalition managers will coordinate high-priority responses and resolve rating discrepancies
and disputes among individual media monitors.</p>

      <h2>Now to December 2018</h2>
      <p>In Year One, we will develop the scalable MMRC website (including
database infrastructure and mapping functionality) and
collaboratively finalize the rating system and appropriate response
mechanisms. </p>
<p>We will enlist and onboard media monitoring partners
in at least three countries (Kenya, Zimbabwe, and South Africa)</p>

SSOGIE MMRC model before adding three to five additional

country partners</p>

      <h2>By year 5</h2>
      <p>We aim to have full Sub-
Saharan coverage by Year Five, pending funding. </p>
<p>By tracking and

indexing media clip ratings in each country over time, we will
quantitatively and qualitatively determine which countries and
outlets experience improvement or deterioration in media coverage,
allowing us to shift resources, mobilize stakeholders and replicate
best practices where need is greatest. </p>
<p>Changes to average story
ratings following specific interventions may also help us determine
the effectiveness of each coalition response. </p>
