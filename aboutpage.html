<h1> About Us </h1>
  <img src="breakingtabooshands.jpg" class= "responsive" width="300px" height="200px">

  <h2>Our Vision</h2>

  <p> Although global media organizations abound, none of them work to
  consistently improve news coverage of the highest stake, taboo
  topics that often fuel violence, bigotry and human rights violations.
  News coverage of LGBTQI, women’s, and religious rights are
  highly inflamed.

  To address this crisis, the top flight Missouri School of Journalism’s
  Center on Religion & the Professions — a Pew Center of Excellence
  — will launch a new media advocacy initiative called Taboom.
  Taboom will advance the human rights of vulnerable, marginalized,
  and disenfranchised communities by improving media coverage of
  the taboo topics affecting their lives and shaping global conflicts.

 </p>

<h2>What We Do</h2>

  <p> Through strategic partnerships and targeted sub-grants, we aim to
enlist at least one media monitoring partner in each country across
Sub-Saharan Africa to regularly
monitor, rate, translate and share local
media coverage of SSOGIE-related
content with the broader coalition
network via a shared platform and
centralized database.
Individual media
monitors will rate each piece of media
coverage using a 10-point scale. The
scale will be used immediately to
triage coalition responses and long

term to monitor country- and region-
specific improvements and

deteriorations in SSOGIE-related
media coverage over time. </p>

<h2> Who We Are </h2>
