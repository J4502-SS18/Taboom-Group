<h1> About Us </h1>
  <img src="breakingtabooshands.jpg" id="breakingtaboos" class= "responsive" width=50% height=auto>

  <h2>Our Vision</h2>

  <h3> Although global media organizations abound, none of them work to
  consistently improve news coverage of the highest stake, taboo
  topics that often fuel violence, bigotry and human rights violations.
  News coverage of LGBTQI, women’s, and religious rights are
  highly inflamed.</h3>
<p>
  To address this crisis, the top flight Missouri School of Journalism’s
  Center on Religion & the Professions — a Pew Center of Excellence
  — will launch a new initiative called Taboom.
  Taboom will advance the human rights of vulnerable, marginalized,
  and disenfranchised communities by improving media coverage of
  the taboo topics affecting their lives and shaping global conflicts.

</p>

<h2>What We Do</h2>

  <p> Through strategic partnerships and targeted sub-grants, we aim to
work with media monitoring partners in each
Sub-Saharan African country to
monitor, rate, translate and share local
media coverage of SSOGIE-related
content with the broader coalition
network via a shared platform and
centralized database.The coalition will use a rating system to respond rapidly to harfuml coverage, and to monitor country- and region-
outlet specific improvements and

deteriorations in SSOGIE-related
media coverage over the long-term. </p>

<h2> Who We Are </h2>
